# Table bucket capacities

* On average, every worker adds `SUBSCRIBERS_PER_MACHINE` (1 M) subscribers to its `SUBSCRIBER` table partition.

* There are 2.5 `ACCESS_INFO` records per subscriber, so 2.5 M `ACCESS_INFO`
  records in total. Similarly, there are 2.5 M `SPECIAL_FACILITY` records.

* There are 1.25 `CALL_FORWARDING` records per `SPECIAL_FACILITY` record, so around 3.2 M `CALL_FORWARDING` records in
  total.

## Index sizing

We allocate 25% extra space in the index for all records:

* `SUBSCRIBER`: 1.25 M
* Secondary `SUBSCRIBER` table: 1.25 M
* `ACCESS_INFO`: 3.2 M -> Does not work so make it 4 M
* `SPECIAL_FACILITY`: 3.2 M -> Does not work so make it 4 M
* `CALL_FORWARDING`: 4 M -> Does not work so make it 5 M

# Additional info

## Table key-value sizes

* All key sizes are fixed at 8 bytes. Value sizes are padded to next multiple of 8 bytes
* `SUBSCRIBER`: 40 bytes
* Secondary `SUBSCRIBER` table: 8 bytes
* `ACCESS_INFO`: 16 bytes
* `SPECIAL_FACILITY`: 8 bytes
* `CALL_FORWARDING`: 24 bytes

## Pool sizing (irrelevant for FixedTable)

On top of an (assumed) 32-byte per-entry pool overhead, allocate 0% extra pool space. Also add the 8-byte HoTS object
header to make the total header size = 40 bytes.

* `SUBSCRIBER`: `(40 + 40) * .125 = 10 MB`
* Secondary `SUBSCRIBER` table: `(40 + 8) * .125 = 6 MB`
* `ACCESS_INFO`: `(40 + 16) * .32 = 18 MB`
* `SPECIAL_FACILITY`: `(40 + 8) * .32 = 16 MB`
* `CALL_FORWARDING`: `(40 + 24) * .4 = 26 MB`
